Contains classes for representations of HTTP messages.
Representation of a HTTP message is an entity that provides access to the actual message
data. For direct HTTP header access it provides references to corresponding HTTP header
representations (see {@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.headers}). Message entity data, if a message
carries one, can be accessed only via using services accessible through provided services
handle (see {@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.services.ServicesHandle}).
<p>
There are two types of representations of HTTP messages, representations of request HTTP
message and HTTP response message. For each type, there are two representations providing
different level of access to HTTP message data, read only access and full access.
<p>
During handling of a HTTP message, the AdaptiveProxy platform distinguishes two
representations of the HTTP message being handled, the representation for the original
message (as received by the proxy), and the representation for the message that will be
sent to the destination. The representation of the original HTTP message is always
read-only. The HTTP message that is / was processed and was / will be sent could be passed
as both read-only and full access representation, depending on particualr situation. To
simplify the plugins API, same read-only representations (interfaces) are used for
messages being processed and original messages.
<p>
Plugins are always provided with the representation for the message being processed. To
make original messages available, this representation provide method that returns the
representation for the original message. Since both representations are of the same
interface, this method is available also for representation for original message. For that
representation, the method returns self.
<p>
<b>Read-only messages</b><br>
For read-only representations of the HTTP messages,
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.messages.HttpRequest} for request message and
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.messages.HttpResponse} for response message, read-only header
representation will be available and provided
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.services.ServicesHandle} will serve only services
(implementations of services) that do not modify message data (header or body
data).
