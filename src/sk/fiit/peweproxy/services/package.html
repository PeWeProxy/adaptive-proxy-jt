Contains classes for services definition and management.
A service is a functionality over HTTP message data on some level of abstraction. All
services (instead of 5 base services, see {@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.services.content} and
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.services.platform.PlatformContextService}) are
provided by service modules - external plugins plugged into the AdaptiveProxy platform (see
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.services}). AdaptiveProxy distinguishes between service
definitions and service implementations. There can be multiple modules that provide different
implementations of the same service definition (service interface) plugged in.
<p>
This package includes base service interface that all created service definitions have to
extend (see {@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.services.ProxyService}). Package also contains interfaces
of services handles (see {@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.services.ServicesHandle} and 
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.services.ChunkServicesHandle}), an entity accessible for each HTTP
message representation / message body's chunk being processed that provides plugins with
services (their implementations) available over the message / message body chunk.
<p> There's also {@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.services.ServiceUnavailableException} runtime
exception defined in this package. This exception is thrown every time a plugin tries to use
a service that is not currently available over particular message. This is when a plugin asks
services handle to provide a service that is unavailable for the current state of a message,
or when a plugin tries to use a service (call its method) obtained in the past, that is no
longer available, because no module can provide it for the current state of a message. Plugins
are not expected to handle this exception gracefully since an AdaptiveProxy platform always
wraps calls to plugins with try-catch block.
