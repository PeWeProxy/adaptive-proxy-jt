<a href="http://peweproxy.fiit.stuba.sk/en">AdaptiveProxy</a> is a platform main goal
of which is to enable personalized and collaborative surfing on the Web.
It is an effort of
<a href="http://wiki.fiit.stuba.sk/research/seminars/pewe/">PeWe</a> group @
<a href="http://www.fiit.stuba.sk/generate_page.php?page_id=749">Faculty of Informatics
and Information Technologies</a> of
<a href="http://www.stuba.sk//new/generate_page.php?page_id=132">Slovak University of
Technology in Bratislava</a> to bring Web surfing experience to another level.
<p>
AdaptiveProxy is realized by extending <a href="http://www.khelekore.org/rabbit/">
RabbIT proxy</a>, fully HTTP 1.1 compliant, powerfull and fast (multithreaded) open
source implementation of a proxy server in Java.
<p>
The platform consist of two components, the proxy base and the plugins extension. The
proxy base is a RabbIT v4.8 proxy code enhanced in a way that enables full integration
of the extension into the HTTP messages handling process and full access to the data of
messages passing through. The plugins extension enables other developers to plug in
additional functionality that modifies the data of HTTP messages by using functionality
provided by other plugins pluged into the proxy.
<p>
The base concept in the plugins environment is the <b>concept of a service</b>. A service
is a functionality over HTTP message data on some level of abstraction. To explain this,
let's consider we have a HTTP message that is valid HTML page showing results of search
on your favorite web search portal. The service on the lowest level of abstraction is
one providing access to the message data in the form of bytes. A service on the next
level provides access to the message represented as a text string and enables all
textual operations (e.g. read, insert, replace) on it. Higher level service could be
one that enables working with message in the form of <a href="http://www.w3.org/DOM/">
Document Object Model</a> (DOM) of HTML elements in the page. Service on even higher
level of abstraction could generalize the message into the collection of abstract search
results structures and provide the methods to reorder them or to add or delete some.
<p>
A service is just a specification of particular functionality over HTTP message. It
defines a structure that is a particular abstraction of the HTTP message, i.e. how is
the message represented in the context of a service (e.g. byte array, text string, DOM,
result set), and operations available on this structure (e.g. move Nth result to Kth
position in result set). It's just a description of what abstract entity a HTTP message
is and what can we do with it.
<p>
The real implementations of a services for particular HTTP message are provided by
special plugins called <b>modules</b>. A module provides the functionality defined by
service specification. To do this, it can use other services - implementation of services,
accessible for the message. For example, implementation of a search result set service
would use implementation of DOM service to identify result entries, which uses
implementation of text service to parse page text into DOM model, which in turn uses
byte service to get raw message data to decode it into text.
<p>
Implementation of services know <i>how</i> to gather particular information from the
message or <i>how</i> to modify the message to make it carry the information we want to.
Other type of plugins, called <b>processing plugins</b>, are those deciding <i>what</i> we
want to gather from the message or <i>what</i> we want a messages to carry. Using currently
accessible services (implementations) in the same way as modules do, these plugins
perform particular task (via telling services what to get / change) on HTTP messages
in order to provide enhanced browsing experience.
<p>
Last family of pluggins pluggable into the platform are <b>event plugins</b>. They are
notified when any client's connection related event (e.g. faliure or timeout) occurs.
<p>
AdaptiveProxy is fully extensible. Declaring additional services and developing
additional modules and processing plugins that process HTTP messages in some new way 
is easy and straightforward through using robust and well defined plugins API. Runtime
environment of services, modules and processing plugins in AdaptiveProxy is fully
reconfigurable in real time, so deploying new modules / plugins or new version of
existing modules / plugins (used libraries included) can be done while the proxy is
running without shuting it down.
