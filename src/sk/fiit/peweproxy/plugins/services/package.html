Contains interfaces for pluggable services modules.
A service module is an external (3rd party) component that provides a service, therefore
knows how to work with HTTP message or part of it's body. It's purpose is to provide
implementation(s) of particular service(s) that know how to gather particular information
from a message / message body chunk or how to modify a message / message body chunk to carry
the information other plugin (processing plugin or another module) wants to. There are two
types of service modules, <b>full message service modules</b> that provide services over
entire HTTP messages and <b>message chunks service modules</b> that provide services over
parts or chunks of bodies of HTTP messages.
<p>
Implementations of full message services can directly read and modify HTTP header of the
message being processed, but can access it's body (if any) only indirectly by requesting
other services present for that message (see {@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.services.ServicesHandle})
and calling their methods.
<p>
Implementations of message chunks services can directly read data already sent - HTTP header
and already sent chunks of body of the message being transfered and can access the content
of the chunk being processed indirectly by requesting other services present for that chunk
(see {@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.services.ChunkServicesHandle}) and calling their methods.
<p>
Modules made to provide services over HTTP requests expose classes implementing
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.services.RequestServiceModule} or
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.services.RequestChunksServiceModule} interface. Modules made
to provide services over HTTP responses expose classes implementing
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.services.ResponseServiceModule} or
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.services.ResponseChunksServiceModule} interface.
<p>
When a request / response HTTP message is processed (real-time or late message processing)
by the AdaptiveProxy platform, a representation of the HTTP message is passed sequentially
to all successfully loaded full request / response processing plugins. To read or modify
processed message, these plugins need to use services available over that message obtained
from message's {@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.services.ServicesHandle}, thus use active modules
indirectly. Also when a request / response body chunks are processed, all successfully
loaded request / response chunks processing plugins are sequentially provided with chunk
context (data already sent and actual chunk content). To read or modify chunk content, these
plugins need to use services available over that message body chunk obtained from provided
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.services.ChunkServicesHandle}, thus use active chunk modules
indirectly.
<p>
<b>Service implementation providing</b><br>
Modules provide services implementation by returning so called <i>service provider</i>
when asked to (by platform passing service definition interface). Service provider in turn
provides service implementation that is an instance that implements service definition
interface and that will be returned to other plugins when they ask for that service. Having
service provider as a wrapper for a service implementation, and not only the implementation
directly, is needed to isolate service usage from introducing changes made by the service
implementation into the actual message / chunk data.
<p>
Since it's ineffective to write changes, caused by using service, to the message / chunk
every single time any method of a service is called, service implementations are expected
to operate on their own inner model of a message, that is written to the message / chunk
later when needed. AdaptiveProxy platform itself keeps watching when it's time to do
that. When its the right time, it is the service provider who introduce changes made in
the inner model of its service implementation to the actual message / chunk. For more
information on requesting service providers and signaling service providers to introduce
changes to the actual message data, see
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.services.ServiceProvider} and it's subclasses.
<p>
Reason for having this 3 layer design (module - service provider - service implementation)
instead of just a module, also performing service provider's job, and a service
implementation, is to enable a service module to provide services that differ in both
identification and implementation. Different identification means that a module is allowed
to provide realizations of different services. Different implementation means that
a module is able to provide different implementations for the same service identification.
For example, a module can provide realizations of the same service, e.g. fictional search
results service, that differ heavily in code, thus being implemented in several other
classes. When asked for a service, a module then decides what class to return as a service
provider, based on actual message data. For example based on whether a message is a results
page of Google, Bing, Yahoo, or other search portal supported by module. 
<p>
<b>Discovering available services</b><br>
AdaptiveProxy platform keeps list of zero or many references to created and provided
service implementations inner models of which are considered up to date. If this list is
not empty, it either holds one or more service implementations inner models of which
are exact transformations of actual message data, or it holds single service
implementation inner model of which was modified so it is not exact transformation of
current message data it was built from.
<p>
Every time a plugin tries to access the message / chunk in a way that would make returned
information inaccurate, the modified inner model of such service implementation, if there
is one in the list, is written back to the actual message / chunk, and the list is cleared
first. This is when plugin tries to read or write HTTP header or use some service
implementation other than only one with up to date inner mode (if there is one).
<p>
Only when an implementation of requested service or service being used is not in the
list (was not created and considered with up to date inner model), modules that are able
to provide that service are requested one by one to return service provider providing
implementation of that service. This is the situation when read only representation of a
HTTP message / message body chunk is passed to modules and they are not expected / allowed
to modify it in any way. That's why base services modifying a message (
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.services.content.ModifiableBytesService} and
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.services.content.ModifiableStringService}) won't be available
during this querying, which means that no message / chunk content modifying services will be
available. First time any module return non <code>null</code> service provider, its service
implementation is added to the list of implementations with up to date inner model.
Providing a service implementation itself can be a process that ends with service
implementation inner model of which is not exact transformation of the actual message data
it was built from. In such cases, service provider is expected to signal this (see
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.services.ServiceProvider#initChangedModel()}).
<p>
<b>Handling data split into multiple chunks</b><br>
Since message body chunks being processed are of different random lengths depending on
multiple factors (size of chunks sent by the message source, speed of the connection vs.
speed of the chunks handling in the proxy, size of the internal buffers used by the proxy),
chunks service modules need to expect that entities in the context of the service may be /
will be split into multiple subsequent chunks. During service providing, when the service
module detects that this is the case, it is expected to save the trailing content of the
chunk that does not form the last complete entity recognized in the chunk - thus being the
heading of the next entity that is broken into multiple chunks, using <i>data holder</i>.
It does so by calling
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.services.DataHolder#ceaseContent(ProxyService, Object)}, passing
a service used to get the lower-level content of the entire chunk and part of this content
that should be ceased until it can be joined with the next chunk.
<p>
To make abstract content ceasing functionality available, a service implementation - chunk
service provider need to be able to handle ceasing parts of its own content (parts of the
abstract representation of the chunk). It does so in its 
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.services.ChunkServiceProvider#ceaseContent(Object, DataHolder)}
method also by calling <code>ceaseContent</code> method of provided data holder and passing
content of the underlying service that represents / forms passed content to cease, and the
underlying service that was used to get such underlying content when this service provider was
created.
<p>
<b>Readonly services</b><br>
Platform also differentiates two types of methods of the services based on what type of
access to the inner model of the service implementation (thus message itself) do they
provide - read only methods and modifying methods. To distinguish whether a method is
read only or not, special annotation
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.services.ProxyService.readonly} is used. If a method in a service
definition (service interface) or a service implementation (provided by service provider)
is annotated with this <code>readonly</code> flag, platform will not clear list of
up to date service implementations, since it consider method to only read inner model of
the service implementation without modifying it in any way.
<p>
For services that, once constructed, do not depend on or change the data of a particular HTTP
message / message body chunk in any way, <code>readonly</code> annotation should be used on
service definition interface. This way AdaptiveProxy platform would know it can omit message
/ chunk guarding mechanism entirely and calling methods of that service won't fire commit of
the changes made by other services to make the data of the HTTP message / message body chunk
actual.
