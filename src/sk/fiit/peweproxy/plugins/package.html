<title>Adaptive Proxy</title>
<body>
Contains interfaces for pluggable Adaptive Proxy plugins.
A plugin is an external (3rd party) component that adds some new functionality to the Adaptive
Proxy platform. To be pluggable into the platform, a plugin bundle must expose a class that
implements at least one <b>processing plugin</b> interface
(see {@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.processing}), <b>service module</b> interface (see
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.events}
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.services}) or <b>event plugin</b> interface, by making it
public and instatiable using public no-arg constructor.  
<p>
<b>Processing plugins</b> are plugins that decide what to do with a HTTP message. To achieve
their goals, they can access the message body via using services that get the information and
/ or modifies the message for them. They are provided with services by HTTP message's services
handle (see {@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.services.ServicesHandle}). 
<p>
<b>Modules</b> or service modules are plugins that provide implementation of particular
services to other plugins. Their purpose is to know how to get or modify information from / of
the message and perform such tasks when some other plugin requests it. 
<p>
Adaptive Proxy distinguishes two types of processing plugins and modules, those plugged into
the process of handling of HTTP requests and those for HTTP responses handling.
<p>
<b>Event plugins</b> are plugins that are notified by the platform when particular event (e.g.
connection close, failure or timeout) happens.
<p>
This package contains common interafce for all plugins (see
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.ProxyPlugin}) that define the way a plugin is loaded,
configured and started. For more details on plugin's life cycle, see methods of this class,
namely {@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.ProxyPlugin#start(PluginProperties)}
method.
<p>
Besides this base plugin interface, this package also contains common interfaces for all
request (see {@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.FullRequestPlugin}) and response plugins (see
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.FullResponsePlugin}), that define the way a request / response
plugins (processing plugins or modules) are asked for services they want to be available
over the HTTP message later in the real-time processing phase. This querying is done by
Adaptive Proxy platform to find out whether some plugin wants to be able to modify the body
of a message in <i>real-time processing</i>, or it can transfer the message body without
changes and make it accessible only afterwards in <i>late processing</i> of a message. 
<p>
<b>Real-time vs. late message processing</b><br>
Data of the HTTP messages are transfered in chunks of bytes as the source of the message sends
more bytes through the connection with the proxy. The most straightforward implementation of
<i>transparent proxy</i> server (see
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec1.html#sec1.3"> RFC 2616: 1.3
Terminology</a>) reads whole HTTP header first, processes it, and then just transfers (sents
bytes as they are being received) the message body to destination. This is also the fastest
way to successfully proxy a HTTP message. To allow plugins to read and modify <u>whole</u>
message content (header and body data) <u>at once</u>, Adaptive Proxy platform (obviously a
<i>non-transparent proxy</i>) have to cache all incoming data of the message first and just
then run message processing. This means that message destination won't receive any message
data (neither header nor body data) until all plugins successfully processed the message what
slows down overall message exchange.
<p>
This is unavoidable if at least one plugin wants to modify a message. But when there's no
such plugin, and all plugins just want to read the message without modifying it, the platform
may use faster data transfer mechanism with caching data passing through, and then run
message processing on cached data. This is where Adaptive Proxy platform differentiates
<i>real-time message processing</i> and <i>late message processing</i>. 
<p>
<u>Real-time message processing</u> is run every time a message is handled before any data of
the message is sent to destination.
<p>
When no plugin wants to modify the message body, it's run just after the message header is
received. During this real-time processing, plugins (processing plugins and modules) are
allowed to read and / or change the header, but no services that depend on body of the message
being processed will be available. After processing, the message header is sent and the
platform starts to transfer message body, if any. In cases when some plugin constructs response
during this processing, no data is sent to the destination web resource, but proxy reads and
caches all incoming data of the request body, if any, runs request late processing and then
starts the process of handling of constructed response as if it was received by the web resource.
<p>
When some plugin wants to modify message body, after the message header is received the
platform starts to cache incoming message body data. After all message data has been received
and cached, it runs this real-time processing, during which plugins can read and / or modify
both header and body content (through services). After processing, the message late processed and
then it's header is sent followed by message body data.
<p>
<u>Late message processing</u> is run every time after all data of the message that was sent or
will be sent is available.
<p>
To simplify the realization of future plugins, that are interested in processing original
messages (as received from the client or web resource), late processing is also run every time.
Either it's run after all data of the message was transfered (and cached in the same time)
without modification (no plugin wanted to), or, when the outgoing message carries no data,
just after real-time processing. This is the situation when read only representation of a
HTTP message is passed to plugins as they are not expected / allowed to modify it in any
way.
<p>
<b>Desired services discovery</b><br>
The decision whether there will be message body accessible during real-time processing (thus
if there will be slowdown in message handling), is made by asking all plugins, if any one wishes
to modify the message, based on received HTTP header of the message. This is recognized as need
of 2 base content modifying services, <code>ModifiableBytesService</code> and
<code>ModifiableStringService</code> (see {@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.services.content}).
<p>
When a HTTP header for incoming request / response message is received (before any
message body data is read), Adaptive Proxy platform requests every request / response
processing plugin to return a list of services (their definitions, i.e. interfaces of
those services) it would like to be able to use later in the processing phase. If it
finds one of these 2 services in the lists, there is a plugins that wants to modify the
message, so that whole body has to be available during real-time processing.
<p>
If these base services are not find in the lists, platform then checks whether these services
aren't "desired indirectly". This is when a plugin (processing plugin or a module), in order
to do what it is made for, wants to be able to use some other service, which could be in turn
provided by plugged-in module if it could use one of these 2 base services, even "indirectly".
If one of these 2 services is "desired indirectly", there is a plugins that wants to modify
the message, so that whole body has to be available during real-time processing.
<p>
<b>Plugin's configuration</b><br>
For the Adaptive Proxy platform, a plugin is a combination of <b>plugin's configuration
file</b> (XML file) in plugins home directory and a plugin bundle (plugin's binaries).
Plugin configuration file contains path to the bundle and the name of exactly one class 
in the bundle that will be loaded and instantiated to become an active plugin entity.
Plugin configuration file also specifies one or more types, that loaded plugin class can
act as (i.e. request/response processing plugin, request/response module or events plugin),
which of course requires the exposed class to implement appropriate interface. Plugin
configuration file and plugin bundle are not tied together (other than configuration file
contains path to the bundle), so there can multiple plugins loaded from the same bundle
(binaries), each with its own plugin configuration file referencing same binaries (even
same class within binaries). For more information on creating valid plugin configuration
file, see
<a href="doc-files/PluginConfiguration.dtd">Plugin configuration schema</a>.
<p>
Besides plugin's own runtime configuration parameters defined in plugin's configuration
file, all plugins can access global configuration parameters called <b>variables</b>,
defined in single variables file "<i>variables.xml</i>" in the plugins home directory. For
more information on creating valid variables file, see
<a href="doc-files/VariablesConfiguration.dtd">Variables configuration schema</a>.
