Contains interfaces for pluggable AdaptiveProxy plugins.
A plugin is an external (3rd party) component that adds some new functionality to the Adaptive
Proxy platform. To be pluggable into the platform, a plugin bundle must expose a class that
implements at least one <b>processing plugin</b> interface
(see {@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.processing}), <b>service module</b> interface (see
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.events}
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.services}) or <b>event plugin</b> interface, by making it
public and instatiable using public no-arg constructor.  
<p>
<b>Processing plugins</b> are plugins that decide what to do with a HTTP message. To achieve
their goals, they can access the message body or it's part via using services that get the
nformation and / or modifies the message or it's part for them. There are two types of processing
plugins, <i>full message processing plugins</i> that are processing whole messages and <i>message
chunks processing plugins</i> that are processing only chunks of messages bodies' data as they are
received from the source of the message. Processing plugins are provided with services by HTTP
message's services handle (see {@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.services.ServicesHandle} and
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.services.ChunkServicesHandle})
<p>
<b>Modules</b> or service modules are plugins that provide implementation of particular
services to other plugins. Their purpose is to know how to get or modify information from / of
the message and perform such tasks when some other plugin requests it. There are also two types
of service modules, <i>full message service modules</i> that provide services over whole messages
and <i>message chunks service modules</i> that provide services over chunks of messages bodies'
data.
<p>
AdaptiveProxy also distinguishes two types of processing plugins and modules, those plugged into
the process of handling of HTTP requests and those for HTTP responses handling.
<p>
<b>Event plugins</b> are plugins that are notified by the platform when particular event (e.g.
connection close, failure or timeout) happens.
<p>
This package contains common interafce for all plugins (see
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.ProxyPlugin}) that define the way a plugin is loaded,
configured and started. For more details on plugin's life cycle, see methods of this class,
namely {@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.ProxyPlugin#start(PluginProperties)}
method. Besides the base plugin interface, this package also contains common interfaces for all
request (see {@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.RequestChunksPlugin}) and response (see
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.ResponseChunksPlugin}) chunks plugins, that define the way a
request / response chunks plugins (processing chunks plugins and chunks modules) are asked for
services they want to be available over the HTTP message chunks later in the chunks processing.
For description of chunks processing see see {@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.processing}
documentation.
<p>
<b>Plugin's configuration</b><br>
For the AdaptiveProxy platform, a plugin is a combination of <b>plugin's configuration
file</b> (XML file) in plugins home directory and a plugin bundle (plugin's binaries).
Plugin configuration file contains path to the bundle and the name of exactly one class 
in the bundle that will be loaded and instantiated to become an active plugin entity.
Plugin configuration file can also specify one or more types, that loaded plugin class can
act as (i.e. request/response processing plugin, request/response module or events plugin),
which of course requires the exposed class to implement appropriate interface. If no types
are explicitly given, AdaptiveProxy platform will evaluate plugin's types dynamically by
trying to use the plugin as it was the plugin of every type.
<br><br>
Plugin configuration file and plugin bundle are not tied together (other than configuration file
contains path to the bundle), so there can multiple plugins loaded from the same bundle
(binaries), each with its own plugin configuration file referencing same binaries (even same
class within binaries). For more information on creating valid plugin configuration file, see
<a href="doc-files/PluginConfiguration.dtd">Plugin configuration schema</a>.
<p>
Besides plugin's own runtime configuration parameters defined in plugin's configuration
file, all plugins can access global configuration parameters called <b>variables</b>,
defined in single variables file "<i>variables.xml</i>" in the plugins home directory. For
more information on creating valid variables file, see
<a href="doc-files/VariablesConfiguration.dtd">Variables configuration schema</a>.
