Contains interfaces for pluggable event plugins.
An event plugin is an external (3rd party) component that is notified by the
platform when particular communication channel (proxy <-> client) related event
(e.g. connection closing, failure or timeout) occurs. There are three types of event
plugins. <b>Connection events plugins </b> (see
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.events.ConnectionEventPlugin}) are notified of
communication channel life cycle events, when a client connects to the proxy or when any
side closes the connection. <b>Timeout events plugins</b> (see
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.events.TimeoutEventPlugin}) are notified when a data
transfer timeout occurs. <b>Failure events plugins </b> (see
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.events.ConnectionEventPlugin}) are notified of data transfer
failure events.
